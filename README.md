# Module-6-Challenge

In this week's challenge we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard. When you search up a city, it will display the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast as well.

The api used for this challenge was the One Call Weather API by openweathermap.org.

Below I have attached a screenshot of the application as well as a link.
